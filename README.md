# Recursion-javascript

- The **Fibonacci Sequence** (using both iterative and recursive methods)
- **Merge Sort** (a recursive sorting algorithm)

## Solutions

### Fibonacci Sequence

1. **Using iteration**
    - Starts with [0, 1] and keeps adding the last two numbers until length n.
    -> [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

2. **Using recursion**
    - Builds the sequence by recursively generating fibsRec(n - 1) and adding the last two numbers to the end.
    ->  This was printed recursively
        This was printed recursively
        This was printed recursively
        This was printed recursively
        This was printed recursively
        This was printed recursively
        This was printed recursively 
        [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

### Merge Sort

- Recursively splits the array into halves, sorts each half, and merges them back together in sorted order.
-> [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
-> [79, 100, 105, 110]
